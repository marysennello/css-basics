<h1>Cats I've Had</h1>
<p>The first cat I remember was a sweet, fluffy gray cat named Oscar. He passed away when I was 3, and soon after we adopted
  two kittens. One was a black and white male we called Tux (short for Tuxedo) and the other was a fluffy orange female that
  my brothers and I wanted to call Tiger Stripes, but my dad went with Hillary, after Sir Edmund Hillary, since she was such
  an active climber. When I was sixteen, a friend gifted me a gray and white kitten I named Dexter. When I left for college
  he stayed with my parents, where he still lives.</p>
<p>In February 2021, my partner and I adopted a two year old brown tabby cat named Teeka, who we quickly renamed to Melon
  Lord (Melon for short) as a reference to one of our favorite shows, "Avatar: The Last Airbender".</p>
